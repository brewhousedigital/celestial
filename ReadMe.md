# Celestial Framework
An easy to use boilerplate for web projects. It has all of the routing, api, javascript, social, seo, and functions that you need to quickly build any project.

## Coming Soon

- [ ] Authentication. This piece is coded but not part of the framework. I need to figure out the best way to make it an optional download.

- [ ] Admin Panel. I want to model this off of [Laravel's Nova platform](https://nova.laravel.com/). Same with the authentication piece, I need to figure out the best way to make this optional.

- [ ] Stripe Payments. Oof. Maybe...

- [ ] Build Celestial into a python Flask project for fun.
